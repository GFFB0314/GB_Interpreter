# GB_Interpreter
A complete programming language interpreter built from scratch in Python. Features a lexer, parser, evaluator, and an interactive REPL. Supports variables, if/else, while loops, user-defined functions, strings, and native built-ins like print() and input(). A perfect project for learning language design.
